# Final-Project
Description: Our visualization shows Urbanization throughout the World and the U.S. The global visualization goes through the years 1961-2023 and has an animation that lets you see the changes throughout the years. The visualization also provides historical context with text at the bottom when there are specifically impacted years. The U.S State map shows the urban population percentage by state. This shows how states have either grown or reduced their urban population through the decades from 1970-2010. This visualization provides people with the insight of urbanization trends and allows them to see how urbanization will continue in the future.
